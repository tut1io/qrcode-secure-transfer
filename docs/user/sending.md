# Sending

Open `/send/`. Two modes, switched at the top: **File** and **Text snippet**.

- **File** — tap **Select File** (any file up to 128 MB). Streaming starts immediately; the button becomes **Stop transfer**. Files are gzip-compressed only when that actually shrinks the optical payload.
- **Text snippet** — paste or type (up to 16 KB), tap **Start text stream**.

While streaming, the status line shows *Streaming ⟨name⟩ — Share receiver link*; the link opens a dialog with a QR of the receiver page, the copyable URL, and the OS share sheet.

**Tap the QR code to make it fullscreen** — as big as the device goes. Tap again (or Esc) to shrink back. A bigger physical code lets the receiver sit farther back or decode denser frames.

Leave the screen brightness at maximum. The stream loops forever; there is no "end" — the receiver finishes on its own.

## Transfer settings

Changing anything restarts the stream; the receiver resets automatically off the new session id. The grid at the bottom of the panel shows what the knobs produced (QR version, fountain blocks K, compression).

| setting | default | notes |
|---|---|---|
| tx fps | 60 | tuned for a 120 Hz sender; on a 60 Hz screen drop to 24–30 if the receiver stalls |
| bytes / frame | 2953 (QR v40) | the density ceiling — great phone-to-phone at close range; back off to 1465 (v27) for monitors or distance |
| error correction | L | the fountain layer handles erasures; L is the right trade at these sizes |
| display size | 900 px | capped by the screen; fullscreen ignores it |

Defaults favor the best-case demo. If a transfer crawls: bytes/frame → 1465, tx fps → 24, in that order.
